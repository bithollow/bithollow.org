Drones belong to the blue sky, green grass, with a breeze... Whilst the sun light showers over their body, they look lovely. Well, that's the fun from DIYers. For me myself, I love that, but, here comes the big **BUT**, when a dangerous trying that might hurt the things you love, what would you do? The answer is simple, take the danger away from the things you love.

Today, it is a quite step for our little prototype, with four 980KV motors, 11 inches propellers and self-modified open source software, my heart is trambling, also exciting. Is it going to fly? Or just crash into the hard ground? Keep your eyes open!

Of course I don't want it to crash into innocent people, so, a place like my parking garage in no mans time would be a good choice. Just wish it won't hit somebody's cars, mines are fine:)

I configured the prototype quad-copter with APM Planner already, just leave it with the default PIDs, here is how it is hovering.

### Hovering with default PID ###

Good, it is actually flying, although the monment is short, but flying. I feel awesome, hours of modifying ardupilot, Dupont wires, bread boards, breakout boards, sensors etc.. I didn't expect all those things work together at the first time can bring the quad-copter into the air. It's in the air though, in front of me, good, isn't it?
