Good day!

Today I wanna go to the field!

It's been a while since in the garage, I guess just guess, the prototype is mature enough to go out. However in a city like Shanghai, a flying ground for such a dangerous act is rare, there's not much of a choice. Luckily, there is a building area near my residence, their constructing is not on going recently. Sneak in...

Hey! Go, never turn around! What? Really?!
