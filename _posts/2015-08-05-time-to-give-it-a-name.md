Since we call our little organization BitHollow, how are about we call the first board **BH**, as the capital letters in the org name. Sounds pretty nice:)

The **BH** board is designed to complement the public development board, adding movement attitude, environment data collecting, PWM I/O etc. With Raspberry Pi, Ardupilot together, to be the solution for unmanned aircraft controller; With any type of development board, one can make prototype for IoT devices, Robotics; In educational field, as a teaching sample, allow students to collect environment data via programming; It is also a good option for electronic model amateur and RC toy design houses.
